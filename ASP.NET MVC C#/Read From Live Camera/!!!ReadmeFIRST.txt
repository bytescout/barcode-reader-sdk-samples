This sample supports all browsers by using 2 modes: 

(required mode is automatically detected by the javascript)
- HTML5 based web camera capture (supported by Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Safari on iOS browsers)
- Flash based web camera capture (supported by Internet Explorer 9+ and any browser with flash support)

IMPORTANT about HTML5 webcamera support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari on desktop and iOS): it is required to run your website (even test website) via SSL connection. Otherwise, web camera won't initialize at all as it requies SSL connection. 

Visual Studio 2008/2010 or higher is required for this sample to run!
